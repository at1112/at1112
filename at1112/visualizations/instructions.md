# Coding Discussion 06

# Instructions

For this coding discussion, please download and clean a publicly available dataset that is of substantive interest to you. Using these data, please produce one publishable-quality visualization that conveys an interesting finding in the data.

By "publishable quality", I mean a plot one could reasonably expect to see in print (academic journals, newspapers, online, etc.). Think carefully about the color scheme, plot choice, and plotting components: the aim is to precisely convey a relationship in the data.

Below are some elements that should be contained within the visualization:

  - Plot contains appropriate titles/captions/axis-labels.
  - Aesthetics clearly delineate between items displayed in the plot.
  - Plot is appropriate for the data.
  - The dimensions of the plot are appropriate.

## Submit

Please submit your answer in a **new folder** titled with your `lastname_firstname` in the `Submissions/` folder. As per usual, submit a Jupyter Notebook. Title the notebook with your lastname_firstname_netid (`doe_john_jd568.ipynb`). Please include your data in your submission folder (**WARNING: your data cannot be over 100mb or it will not upload to Github. If your data is larger than 100mb, provide code or instructions so that a classmate is capable of downloading your data locally.**). Please submit your answer to the class repository by Friday 11:59pm deadline.

## Response

Please do not respond to anyone's code until after the Friday deadline. Please submit a response by Sunday 11:59pm. Your response should come in the form of a contribution or edit to someone else's code (not just a comment).

- Is there a way you could potentially improve open the logic they laid out by say making the code more concise or efficient?
- Is there another way you could structure the manipulation so that it played out in less steps?
- Is there something interesting in the data that you found that might build off what the original author found?
